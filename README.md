# Uber Exploratory Data Analysis 

This project focuses on analyzing Uber ride data to uncover insights into travel patterns and trends. By performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, we delve into the dataset to understand peak travel times, popular routes, and potential data gaps.



## Objectives

- Identify Peak Travel Periods
Utilize EDA techniques to determine peak travel months, days, and hours.

- Analyze Data Gaps 
Investigate missing data points and assess potential implications on analysis outcomes.

- Uncover Insights
Extract valuable insights from the data to inform decision-making and optimize operations.



## Key Findings

- December Peak Travel: December emerges as a peak travel month, attributed to the holiday season
